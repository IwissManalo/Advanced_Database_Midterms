# 🖥️ Forum Application 

<p>⚙️Our Advanced Database Midterms project called <i>"Forum Application"</i> developed using Java programming language for the backend and MySQL for the database management. This application allows users to create accounts, post questions, and engage in discussions within various topics. It incorporates advanced database concepts such as normalization, indexing, and efficient querying to ensure optimal performance and data integrity. Users can interact with the forum through a user-friendly interface, which includes features like creating, reading, updating, and deleting. We also added built-in operations to perform! 
  
<br>💾This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in database design, implementation, and integration within a real-world application context. </p>
